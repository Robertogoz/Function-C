# Function-C

Some exercises about functions in C.


 * In Ex01 i create 2 functions: "maior()" and "menor()", maior() read 2 numbers and compare to see which is biggest and return the biggest one and menor() does exactly the opposite.

 * In Ex02 i create a function that scan 10 students's grades, calculate the average and print the students's grade average

 * In Ex03 i create a function that calculate a square of a number 

 * In Ex04 i create a function that identify if a number is odd or even(positive, negative or zero), so i print the answear

 * In Ex05 i create a function that create a array with N numbers, read all N numbers and return the higher one
 
 * In Ex06 i create a function that compare 2 doubles and return 0 if a == b, 1 if a > b and -1 if a < b
 
 * In Ex07 i create 4 functions: 
     
     * `int multiplica(int x1, int x2)`: that returns x1 * x2;
     * `int quadrado(int x)`: that returns X²;
     * `int cubo(int x)`: that returns x³;
     * `int pol_cubo(int a, int b, int c, int d, int x)`: that returns ax³ + bx² + cx + d;
    
 * In Ex08 i create 2 functions : 
 
     * `void printMatriz(int l, int c, int matriz[l][c])`: that receive a matrix and your size and prints a 3x3 matrix in output.
     * `int processMatriz(int l, int c, int x, int matriz[l][c])`: that receive a matrix, your size and a integer x and replace all elements less then x by 0 and return a number(int) of alterations.

 * In Ex09 i create 2 functions : 

     * `void inverter(int *vetor, int n)` that receive an array and your size and invert an array elements.
     * `void printVetor(int *vetor, int n)` that receive an array and your size and print the array.

* In Ex10 i create a function called `retangulo()` that receive int X and int Y and that function print a rectangle with height X and width Y.

* In Ex11 i create a function called `triangular()` that receive int X and verify if X is a triangular number. 

* In Ex12 i create 3 functions :

     * `int pot(int bas, int exp)`: that function returns the following result: bas ^ exp.
     * `void potvetor(int tam, int vetor[], int exp)`: that function calls `int pot()` function to every single element of array passed as argument.
     * `void printvetor(int tam, int V[tam])`: that function prints the array passed as argument.
